## Final Project, Part II 
(you can view Part I of my project [here](/project-part1.md))

### Wireframes and Storyboarding

For this aspect of my project, I decided to jump right in to drafting the project directly in Esri's StoryMaps. An advantage I have in this stage is really good data that lend themselves well to visualizations (e.g. time series, statistics) so my thought process was that I would create the visualizations first based on what I wanted to say the most, and allow them to drive the story's direction. 

Here is the embedded draft version:

When crafting the data visualizations, my intent was to keep the design simple and clean. I found the data to be particularly compelling, and as such wanted to let it speak for itself without being clouded by distracting design elements. I sought to keep the same color scheme throughout the story to instill cohesion. I also wanted to convey key insights using headlines so that it was clear to readers what the main takeaways were. 

One data point I thought a lot about how to convey was the growth in the number of test optional colleges and universities in the United States. I had time series data back to 2004, but the most significant growth occured between 2020-2022. I initially tried using a standard line graph, but found that the data points in the years between were not conveying vital information. I instead wanted to showcase two snapshots in time to show a dramatic increase. After playing around with a few designs, I settled on a data callout using bubbles and the numbers themselves to emphasize the growth in the data.

I also wanted to bring a human side to the story and convey the perspective of individual students, rather than just their test scores. To do so, I constructed a series of unit charts showcasing how diverse test takers are as a cohort, which spotlighted bilingual, non-white, and first-generation students. This was an essential part of the storyline--these students pay money and put in the time to do well on this test, and yet they consistently score lower than white, wealthy students whose parents are well-educated. 

### User Research and Interviews

My main focus for my user research phase was to focus on the storytelling elements of my project. I of course wanted to seek feedback on the visualizations themselves, but one aspect I was struggling with during the wireframing phase was crafting a logical and compelling story arc. I went into my user research phase wanting specific feedback on story flow and appeal to the targeted audience.

#### Interviewees and Script

I used the following script for my interviews:

When selecting interviewees, I wanted to get feedback from at least one member of my intended audience: a college admissions administrator. However, given the short time frame, I wasn't able to track down a suitable interviewee. Instead, I sought feedback from more accessible users who although not members of my target audience were educated and discerning about stories and data visualizations.

#### Findings

#### Trends and Next Steps

One common thread I found between several interviews is that there are holes in the argument I'm making in this project--I picked a provocative topic and moving forward on the call to action is a very high-stakes decision, so there needs to be detailed, convincing evidence to sway my audience. At this point in the project I think it's too late to change topics, but I do intend to incorporate that feedback and fill in some of the argument's holes. It brought up the question of what this project is really about--yes, we're trying to convince our readers, but is the focus the solidity of the argument, or the data visualizations themselves? At this stage given my resources I intend to fill in as much as possible of the argument, but it's such a large topic that visualizations may not be enough to convince my audience.

**Things that work:**
All of my interviewees communciated that they were very engaged by the presentation, given the nature of the content but also the structure of the narrative. All were hooked by the opening section on _why_ students feel the need to take the SAT and perform well on it, I think because it answers an essential question many readers will have _before_ they have it. Another universal positive was the quality of the visualizations themselves. All interviewees conveyed that they were clear in their simplicity, thought-provoking, and conveying the information they intended to convey effectively. Some of the visualizations received universal praise: the line chart on race disparities, the dot chart conveying the growth of test optional schools; and the rise of bachelor's degrees line chart.

**Things that didn't work:**
There were some divergent opinions on whether some of the viz was effective in supporting my central argument. Two users loved the unit charts and the people-centered perspective they brought; another thought they were the equivalent of a pie chart and didn't add much to the story. Some thought all the charts played an important role; others pointed out ones that weren't playing much of a part, such as the gender bar chart. Two users thought the test optional schools graphic needed a point of reference rather than raw numbers, which was helpful feedback. I was also left with helpful feedback about my gender bar chart by portraying it as a line chart to more clearly show the effect.

**Things to change:**
Given my user feedback, I developed the following list of items I intend to change before my final presentation:

_Charts_:
* Change test optional schools graphic to reflect a proportion
* Make scale on test optional schools graphic more dramatic
* Change bar chart for gender disparities to a line chart and add more context for why this might be the case
* Change colors on all charts so that colors represent the same thing (gender, race, etc.)

_Story_:
* Make audience more clear at beginning of presentation
* Add an emotional appeal aspect--what is the effect of this on students? Perhaps find direct quotes.
* Add more text from research to add context and supporting evidence to viz to show the "why" rather than just the "what"
* Add section on schools that have already done this and succeeded (a test case)
* Incorporate more photos to bring personal aspect to story (pictures of students?); Remind the audience _who_ this affects!
