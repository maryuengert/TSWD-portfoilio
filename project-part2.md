## Final Project, Part II 
(you can view Part I of my project [here](/project-part1.md))

### Wireframes and Storyboarding

For this aspect of my project, I decided to jump right in to drafting the project directly in Esri's StoryMaps. An advantage I have in this stage is really good data that lend themselves well to visualizations (e.g. time series, statistics) so my thought process was that I would create the visualizations first based on what I wanted to say the most, and allow them to drive the story's direction. 

Here is the embedded draft version:

When crafting the data visualizations, my intent was to keep the design simple and clean. I found the data to be particularly compelling, and as such wanted to let it speak for itself without being clouded by distracting design elements. I sought to keep the same color scheme throughout the story to instill cohesion. I also wanted to convey key insights using headlines so that it was clear to readers what the main takeaways were. 

One data point I thought a lot about how to convey was the growth in the number of test optional colleges and universities in the United States. I had time series data back to 2004, but the most significant growth occured between 2020-2022. I initially tried using a standard line graph, but found that the data points in the years between were not conveying vital information. I instead wanted to showcase two snapshots in time to show a dramatic increase. After playing around with a few designs, I settled on a data callout using bubbles and the numbers themselves to emphasize the growth in the data.

I also wanted to bring a human side to the story and convey the perspective of individual students, rather than just their test scores. To do so, I constructed a series of unit charts showcasing how diverse test takers are as a cohort, which spotlighted bilingual, non-white, and first-generation students. This was an essential part of the storyline--these students pay money and put in the time to do well on this test, and yet they consistently score lower than white, wealthy students whose parents are well-educated. 

### User Research and Interviews

My main focus for my user research phase was to focus on the storytelling elements of my project. I of course wanted to seek feedback on the visualizations themselves, but one aspect I was struggling with during the wireframing phase was crafting a logical and compelling story arc. I went into my user research phase wanting specific feedback on story flow and appeal to the targeted audience.

#### Interviewees and Script

I used the following script for my interviews:

Goals | Questions
