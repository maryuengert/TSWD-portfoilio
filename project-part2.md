## Final Project, Part II 
(you can view Part I of my project [here](/project-part1.md))

### Wireframes and Storyboarding

For this aspect of my project, I decided to jump right in to drafting the project directly in Esri's StoryMaps. An advantage I have in this stage is really good data that lend themselves well to visualizations (e.g. time series, statistics) so my thought process was that I would create the visualizations first based on what I wanted to say the most, and allow them to drive the story's direction.
