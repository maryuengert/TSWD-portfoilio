# About Me
Hello world! My name is Mary Yuengert (she/her/hers) and I am a soon-to-graduate Master of Science in Public Policy and Management candidate at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. Before coming to Heinz, I worked in both non-profit and government spaces, including working for a Senator and a Senate committee in Washington. I am most interested in social policy issues--homelessness, income inequality, hunger, and education--and developing solutions to those problems through legislation or social programs. In my free time (if I have any), I like to run, hike, cook, and tend to my growing family of houseplants. 

# What I hope to learn
Personally, I'm not a visual learner. I am a writer by trade and in fact, I usually skip over the charts and graphs in an article (oops). I'm hoping that by seriously studying and practicing the art of creating dataviz that's effective at telling stories, I can trick myself into caring about charts and hopefully create some cool ones of my own that will interest others. 

I'm also interested in this class (Telling Stories with Data) to prepare for my future employment. After graduation, I will be working as a Data Analytics and Applied AI Consultant with Deloitte's Government and Public Service practice. I know that my work will require me to not only analyze data but to communicate it to clients effectively, so having a solid understanding of how to create good visualizations will be essential.
