#### Comparing OECD Debt-to-Ratio visualizations:
    There are two aspects of the OECD Debt-to-GDP ratio dataset that are essential to telling a compelling story: the ratio itself, but also the trend over time. In the bar chart, the viewer can see ratios for all OECD countries in a single year, which limits the ability to understand any global context which may impact countries' borrowing habits and production output year to year. The sparklines visualization, while displaying time trends, spaces out each country's data which inhibits the viewer's ability to compare countries' ratios on a single scale. It makes it difficult to determine countries with the highest and lowest ratios. 
    The line chart accomplishes both tasks--it allows the viwer to see the trend of ratios over time for all countries, while using color to draw the viewer's attention to outliers. To add another dimension to the narrative, I used GDP data from the World Bank to group outliers by relative GDP level--blue represents countries in the top ten of the global GDP ranking, while red represents countries who fall near the bottom of the GDP distribution. This reminds viewers that the interpretation of the debt-to-GDP ratio depends on GDP size: while high borrowing for high GDP countries can demonstrate good credit ratings, high borrowing for low GDP countries can be a sign of financial trouble.
