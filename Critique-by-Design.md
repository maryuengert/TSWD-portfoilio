### Selecting a visualization for redesign

The original data visualization I worked with in this assignment came from an [Urban Institute](https://apps.urban.org/features/education-equity-tool/) tool used to show the gap between white and Black students' access to critical education resources. Research shows that access to certain resources such as adequate counseling, AP classes, and experienced teachers have a significant impact on educational outcomes. However, this access isn't equally distributed across student groups, particularly when racially stratified.
