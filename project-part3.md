### Final Data Story
This week I put everything from the past few weeks together to assemble my final project, which can be found [here](https://arcg.is/09by8b). 

Throughout this process, I found the biggest challenge to be determining how to structure a story effectively for a given audience. My initial sketches (which can be found in [Part I](/project-part1.md)) lacked a point of view and did not target my audience effectively. As my audience evolved from the general educated public to college administrators specifically, I made decisions with that audience in mind that resulted in a more cohesive story. For example, I decided to keep my visualizations simple to allow the data to shine. I added an aspect of the story that revealed the stakes of my audience's decisions--potentially dampening lifetime wages for nonwhite, first-generation, or low-income students who were barred admission from a great college because of their SAT score. I spoke directly to the audience in the call to action. These elements solidified the intended audience for my story.

Regarding my visualizations, I made some slight changes from those found in my wireframes in [Part II](/project-part2.md). The biggest change I made concerns the section, "What do high school students feel the need to take the SAT?" My initial thought process for this section was that I wanted to show how more people were going to college, and therefore the college market was more competitive. However, I found myself constantly asking the question, "Why do people need to go to college?" Luckily, I already had wage data for different educational attainment levels, and using a slope chart, I highlighted how wages for bachelor's degree holders grew the most over the past 25 years, while wages for other educational groups stayed mostly stagnant. I then overlayed this data onto data on the growing number of bachelor's degree holders in ths U.S., solidifying the trend that rising wages led to greater demand for a college deree. This provided an important "why" component to the story, and gave the issue higher stakes.  

I also made changes to make the story more cohesive. Given the negative user research on the matter, I scrapped my gender chart because it wasn't contributing much to my story. It also did not have a strong counterpart in the "unit chart" section of my project, which as a reader felt like failing to meet my expectations. Seeking this parallel structure, I  restructured these sections and added a new visualization to convey to readers that these diverse groups show up to test, but consistently don't perform well.

Other changes to visualizations included:
+ Changing the "Test Optional Schools" graphic from absolute numbers to proportions to provide a frame of reference for readers
+ Adjusting the color scheme to be clear yet cohesive throughout the story
+ Adding photos of students to appeal to the audience's pathos

I also filled in the remaining gaps in my argument on topics like why such discrepancies might exist, how the SAT does at predicting college performance, and the implications for schools of going test optional. With these sections, I tried to anticipate my audience's concerns and outstanding questions by including summary information as well as links to further research. These final sections of my story did not lend themselves well to data visualizations, unfortunately. However, a surface level addressing of the research seemed important to answer my audience's questions. With more time and resources, I think I could make an informational graphic on some of these topics which could be distributed to other readers, such as "Implications for Going Test Optional".

### Final thoughts
My biggest takeaways from this class and from doing this project are:
+ Let the data speak for itself by keeping visualizations clear and simple without too many design distractions
+ Listen to how data is being described in your conversations about it and let that lead you to the appropriate visualization
+ Consider your audience's interests, questions, and concerns when writing your story, and tailor it to them
