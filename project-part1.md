### Outline 
For decades, the Scholastic Appitude Test (SAT) administered by the College Board has been the go-to tool for demonstrating and measuring college readiness in the college admissions process. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of the SAT has faced numerous obstacles as testing centers have closed and colleges have temporarily or permanently foregone testing requirements in the admissions process. While the College Board attempts to reform the exam to maintain relevance, this project will present evidence that the SAT does a poor job at measuring college readiness and serves as a major barrier to students of color, low-income students, and/or first-generation students accessing competitive universities and should be abandoned as an admissions requirement or consideration.

The project's major features are:

- The relevance of the SAT in college admissions over time
- The ability of the SAT to predict college performance
- Examination of discrepancies in test scores by testtaker attributes, such as gender, race, and income status

### Initial Sketches



### Data
The primary data sources for this project will be the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through the U.S. Department of Education, The National Center for Fair and Open Testing, and data from the College Board.

NCES:
I will use the following data sets to visualize the SAT scores of students by various student characteristics over time:

- [SAT mean scores ... by selected student characteristics, 1995-1996 - 2015-2016](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_226.30.asp)
- [SAT mean scores of college bound seniors, by sex 1966-67 - 2015-16](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_226.20.asp?current=yes)
- [Number, percentage distribution, and SAT mean scores of high school seniors taking the SAT, by sex, race/ethnicity, first language learned, and highest level of parental education: 2017 through 2020](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d20/tables/dt20_226.10.asp?current=yes)

National Center for Fair and Open Testing:
I plan to use the data sets listed below to demonstrate how standardized tests like the SAT have lost relevance in college admissions over time, and call out the number of schools who have implemented a test blind admissions policy.

- [Test Optional Schools 2005-2022](https://www.fairtest.org/sites/default/files/Optional-Growth-Chronology.pdf)

College Board:
I will be using data from the College Board's SAT Program Participation and Performance Statistics reports, which can be found [here](https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/sat/data).


### Method and Medium
I plan to display this story using ArcGIS Storymaps.
